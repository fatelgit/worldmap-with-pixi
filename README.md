This is a working example for rendering a tmx file into your browser using pixi.js. Tileset and tmx taken from the [Tiled examples](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/tree/master/examples)
 
## Requirements

You need some libraries. First of all jQuery (currently 3.1.1) and pixi.js of course (currently 4.1.1). They are loaded from cdn. Furthermore I am using the great gameloop implementation from
Isaac Sukin called ['MainLoop.js'](https://github.com/IceCreamYou/MainLoop.js)

## How to use?

You can just scroll through the code here or simply checkout the project to run it in you local environment. A webserver is required to load local files like *.tmx. Alternatively you could
modify you browsers cross origin policy but I wouldn't recommend that.
